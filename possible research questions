# Research Questions 
A. Descriptive / Situational Problems
1.	Where are maternal mortality rates the highest and lowest?
Identify geographic “hotspots” of high MMR (Maternal Mortality Ratio).
2.	How have MMRs changed over time (2000–2022)?
Detect upward or downward trends by region or country/state.
3.	What is the distribution of MMR across income groups or continents?
Compare averages among low-, middle-, and high-income countries.
4.	Which populations or demographic groups face higher risks?
Examine disparities by race/ethnicity, age, or rural vs. urban.

B. Correlational / Determinant Problems
5.	Which factors are most correlated with MMR?
GDP per capita, fertility rate, health expenditure, % skilled birth attendance, education level, etc.
6.	Does higher healthcare spending reduce MMR?
Compare countries/states by expenditure quartile and mean MMR.
7.	What is the relationship between adolescent birth rates and maternal deaths?
Scatterplot + regression analysis.

C. Predictive / Modelling Problems
8.	Can we predict future MMR values based on historical data?
Use time series models (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.).
9.	Can we classify a country/state as “high risk” vs. “low risk”?
Train classification models using socioeconomic indicators.
10.	Can we cluster regions with similar maternal health profiles?
Apply K-means or hierarchical clustering (as explained earlier).

D. Inequality & Disparity Problems
11.	How large are racial or ethnic disparities in maternal mortality?
Compare U.S. groups (e.g., Black, White, Hispanic, Asian).
12.	Does location (urban/rural) influence MMR when controlling for socioeconomic status?
Perform stratified or multivariate analysis.
13.	How does education level or access to prenatal care mediate risk?

E. Policy & Intervention Problems
14.	Which states/countries improved the most from 2000–2020?
Identify top performers and analyze what policies coincided.
15.	If certain interventions increase skilled birth attendance, how much could MMR drop?
Scenario simulation using regression coefficients or predictive model.
